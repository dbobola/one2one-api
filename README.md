## Project Date:
> July, 2020.

## Project Description: 
> Influencers and experts use one2one to offer you personalized services such as advice, exclusive content, and coaching of any kind. One2one had a small engineering and operations team and as Head of Operations at One2One, i ran managerial tasks alongside running some needed Operation tasks like provisioning our Client-Request API using Docker, Terraform, Azure  and Azure DevOps.

## Concept:
This repo and guide does not entail One2One Client-API as it is an organization resource so I utlized the weatherForecast template API. 
> Oh well, In the spirit of DevOps, i wrote this guide in Yaml declarative syntax as an Infrastructure Guide (literallyðŸ˜‰). This is just a concept i came up with just for the love of DevOps and IaaC. So you need a basic understanding of Yaml to follow-through.

Oh Yeah, I will help you outðŸ˜‰: <br />
Sample of pipeline code you will see in this guide:

```yaml
stages:
- stage: Create demo.text file in VS Code
  jobs:
  - job: Open VSCode
    steps:
    - Tap: Windows key
    - Type: "VS Code" 
    - Click: Open 
   
  - job: Create .txt File
    steps:
    - Click: File
    - Select: New File
    - Type: "demo.text"
    - Tap: Enter

```
So what did we do? Here we wanted to create a demo.txt file in VS Code. So the first "job" was to "Open VS Code" by tapping the windows key, and searching and opening for VS Code in the windows pane. After we open VS code, we clciked on the file menu, chose "new file" from the drop down and created a text file.
